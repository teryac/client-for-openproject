# Client for OpenProject

# Privacy Policy & Data Deletion

This policy applies to the **OpenProject Mobile Client** developed by **[Your Developer Name]**.

## Data Deletion Request
Users can request the deletion of their account and associated data through the following prominent steps:

1. **Self-Hosted Instances:** As this app is a client for third-party servers, please contact your organization's System Administrator to request permanent account and data deletion.
2. **OpenProject Cloud:** Log in to your account via the web interface at [community.openproject.org](https://community.openproject.org), navigate to **User Settings** > **Delete Account**.

## Data Retention & Types
* **Deleted Data:** Upon request to your administrator, all personal profile data, work packages, and attachments are deleted from the server.
* **Kept Data:** We do not retain any user data on our own servers.
* **Local Data:** To delete local data (Server URL and API Token), simply **Log Out** or **Uninstall** the app. This removes all hardware-encrypted data from your device immediately.

## Data Collected
* **Crash Logs:** Handled by Firebase Crashlytics for stability. This data is technical (device model, OS version) and contains no personal project data.
