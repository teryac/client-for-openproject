This Privacy Policy describes how your information is handled.

## 1. Data Storage & Security
Your data remains on your device.
* **Local Storage:** Your OpenProject URL and API tokens are encrypted and stored locally on your device. They are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party storage.
* **Direct Communication:** The app communicates directly with your specified OpenProject instance. We do not act as a "middle-man" or proxy.

## 2. Third-Party Services
To improve app stability, we use the following third-party service:
* **Firebase Crashlytics:** We collect anonymous crash reports to help us fix bugs. This data does not include your OpenProject content, URLs, or credentials. You can view Google’s Privacy Policy [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 3. Data Retention
Because all data is stored locally, it is deleted immediately when you logout, uninstall the app, or clear the app's cache.

## 4. Transparency & Open Source
The code for this application is open-source. You can audit our data handling and security practices at any time via our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/teryac/client-for-openproject).

## 5. Children’s Privacy
This application is intended for use by individuals aged 18 and over. We do not intentionally target or collect information from children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions).
